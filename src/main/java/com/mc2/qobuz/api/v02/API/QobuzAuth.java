    * API use and application authentification

    * In order to use our API, you need to authenticate your application by 
    * sending an application ID parameter expressed as app_id along with method 
    * specific arguments to the root endpoint for all API calls. 
    * 
    * Please contact api@qobuz.com to request your application credentials 
    * (app_id and app_secret values). 
    * Don't forget to provide us with your Qobuz login or email.

    * Example

    * http://www.qobuz.com/api.json/0.2/status/test?app_id=100000000
    
    * Disclaimer : Please note that your app_id and app_secret are strictly
    * personal and should not be given to any other parties without the explicit
    * consent of Qobuz.

    * You must make sure that the email address associated with your developer 
    * account (ie the account associated with the app_id and app_secret given) 
    * is always valid at any time and that the developer can be reached at this 
    * address. Failure to do so will result in the immediate suspension of the 
    * app_id and app_secret associated.

    * Any use of the API implies your full acceptance of their Terms of Use 
    * (http://www.qobuz.com/apps/api/QobuzAPI-TermsofUse.pdf).
